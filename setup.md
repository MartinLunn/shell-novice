## Getting lesson materials

You need to download some files to follow this lesson:

1. Download [shell-novice-data.zip]({{ page.root }}/data/shell-novice-data.zip) and move the file to your Desktop.
2. Unzip/extract the file (ask your instructor if you need help with this step). You should end up with a new folder called data-shell on your Desktop.

In the lesson, you will find out how to access the data in this folder.


## Installing Linux terminal software

### Windows 10 Users

To be able to participate in this lesson we will need you to install some software to give you access to a command shell. MobaXTerm is a powerful terminal program for Windows. It allows you to use Linux commands on a Windows PC. The free Home Edition of MobaXterm can be found [here](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html).

Once you have installed MobaXTerm, run the program. Then click the *Start local terminal* button in the middle of the MobaXterm window.

MobaXterm users will also need to install the nano program.  To do this from your MobaXterm local terminal, type `mobapt install nano` followed by the Enter key.

Once you have gotten to this point you are ready to participate in the lesson.

### Mac Users

To open a terminal window on a Mac, navigate to Applications/Utilities and open Terminal. Once you have reached this stage you are ready to participate in the lesson.
